      Hello! I'm Chelsea. Welcome to my digital home.
    </p>
    A few things about me. I love the liberal arts. I sing, act, and write songs and have a blog. I recently did a musical and play that was featured in Broadway World and other theatre magazines. I independently release music and love the liberal arts.
