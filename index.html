      Hello! I'm Chelsea. Welcome to my digital home. Here is a little bit about me. 
      I love the liberal arts and songwriting. I relase music independently and I was recently in a musical and play earlier this year that was reviewed in Broadway World and other theatre magazines on the West Coast as well. I also have a blog on wordpress called Tailored Sunflower. I have lived in Los Angeles for over a decade but I have Texas Roots.
